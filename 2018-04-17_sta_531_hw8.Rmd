#### (1) Bidirectional Dependence

By the Markov property, we know that $X_i$ is independent of $X_{j<i}$ given $X_{i-1}$. If we think of this a graphical model, we know that
$$
X_k \perp \{ X_{j<k} \notin Pa(X_k) \} \mid Pa(X_k).
$$

Take $k > i+1$ in the above theorem and we see that, given $X_{i+1}$, $X_{j>i}\perp X_i$.

Now, let's consider the case where we are given only $X_{i-1}$. Then, we can invoke the if and only if definition of d-separation. 
$$
A \perp B \mid S \iff S \text{ d-separates } A, B
$$

Take $A = \{X_i\}, B = \{X_{j>i}\}, S = \{X_{i-1}\}$ in the above. Clearly, $S$ does not separated $A$ and $B$, and we see that we do not get independence of $X_i$ from its descendants.
